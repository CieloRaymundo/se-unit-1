Recreate [this tribute](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx) page using semantic HTML and CSS.

### Directions
1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/The-Marcy-Lab-School/se-unit-1)
2. Clone the repo to your local environment
3. Change directories into `se-unit-1/lesson-0-semantics/tribute-lab`
