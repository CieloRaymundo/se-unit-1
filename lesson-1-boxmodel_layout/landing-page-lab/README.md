# Unit 1 - Lesson 1: Box Model and Layout Foundations
## Learning Lab - Landing Page Mockup

### Objective 
* On the job, a designer (or you!) might create a wireframe or a mockup of what your app or site should look like. It will then be your job to translate this into front end code.
* Your task for this lab is to recreate [this "Mockup"](https://www.figma.com/proto/Vm0MzNYpiV6ihbQHOb1SCH/9.12.19-Code-a-long-1?scaling=min-zoom&node-id=1%3A3) for a journal/blog webpage.
* Be sure to use _semantic HTML_ and all that you've learned about `display` properties to get as close to a _pixel perfect_ recreation of this mockup as possible!

### Directions
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the repo to your local environment
3. Make changes to `index.html` and `style.css` in order to create a site that is nearly identical to the mockup.
4. Add, commit, and push your changes to your remote repository when you are complete.

**Note**: If you would like to make changes to the text, color scheme, or photo on this page, feel free. I'm most concerned with how closely you can match the _layout_ of the mockup.
